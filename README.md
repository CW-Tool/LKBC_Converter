# LKBC_Converter
World of Warcraft M2 models converter from version 08 (Wrath of the Lich King) to 07-04 (The Burning Crusade).
Written in ANSI C, documented with Doxygen, tested with CuTest, made with love and tears.

What's yet to be implemented :
	Models with .anim files (that also means character models can't be converted yet)
	Lights
	Ribbons
	Particles
	
This is still heavy work in progress. I want to have strong, working, well-designed structures before moving too much forward.

Original idea and structures by Stan84.

Thanks to Stan84, PhilipTNG, Schlumpf and all the people who contributed to M2&M2/WotLK pages on the WoWDev wiki.
If you want to contribute and have ANSI C knowledge, feel free to send me a message. ;)
